You are given extracted data from  two sources: PDF, Web,. These contain structured information from rent contracts.

Your task is to:
1. Extract the following fields from each source (if available):
"Building" (this field will contain word "ซีพี" ),

  "Brand Name" (ชื่อร้าน or brand name),

  "Unit ID", (in this format PXXXX where x is the number )
  "Space (NLA)", (Area in square meter),
  "Billing Frequency",
  "Monthly charge", (Output in "Yes", or "No"),

• Compare the meaning of the PDF and web values: if both indicate a fixed rate, or both indicate a variable rate, set match:true; otherwise match:false.

"Year 1 : Monthly Amount of rent",  
• Compare the underlying numeric value in PDF vs. web. If they represent the same amount, set match:true; otherwise match:false.

  "Other service charge (in the renting space)",
   • If the “Other service charge (in the renting space)” amount is “0”, treat this field as match:true even if it’s empty or missing.  
  • Otherwise, read both PDF and web descriptions and judge whether they refer to the same service—match true if they express the same concept (e.g. Thai “สำหรับไอเย็น” means “Cool Air Service Fee”).

  "Other service charge (in the renting space) Charge description", (if "Other service charge (in the renting space)" is 0, this field valid of null)
  "Other service charge (in the renting space) start date"
  "Other service charge (in the renting space) end date"
  "Other service charge (public space)",
   • If the “Other service charge (public space)” amount is “0”, treat this field as match:true even if it’s empty or missing.  
  • Otherwise, interpret both PDF and web descriptions by their meaning and context—mark match:true if they describe the same service.
 

  "Other service charge (public space) Charge description",(if "Other service charge (public space)" is 0, this field always valid )
  "Other service charge (public space) start date",
  "Other service charge (public space) end date",

  "Include Utility", (output in "Yes" or "No")
  "Utilities charge (water)", 
  "Utilities charge (Electricity)",
  "Utilities charge (cooking gas)", 

  "Total Rent Deposits",
  "Total Service Deposits",
  "Lease property tax", 
  When extracting the “Lease property tax” field, apply these rules to decide if the PDF value is valid compared to the web value:
	1.	Web value: “PTS-PT Standard”
	•	PDF value must be exactly “10.00” to be valid.
	2.	Web value: “PT Mall”
	•	PDF value must be exactly “12.5” to be valid.
	3.	Web value: null or missing
	•	PDF value must be “0” to be valid.


2. Compare each field across the sources.

3. Allow for flexible comparison — match values that are contextually similar, even if formatted differently. Examples:
   - "March 10, 2025" vs "10/03/2025"
   - "$1,000.00" vs "1000"
   - "ซีพี" vs "CP"
   - With/without commas, units like "THB", or different date formats

4. If a value is missing in one or more sources, mark the match as **false**.

5. Return the result as a list of objects in this JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "field": "Customer",
    "pdf": "Wisarut Gunjarueg",
    "web": "Mr. Wisarut G.",
    "match": true,
    "reason": "All refer to the same person with different naming styles"
  },
  {
    "field": "Rent charge",
    "pdf": "$15,000.00",
    "web": "15000",
    "match": true,
    "reason": "Same value represented in different formats"
  },
  {
    "field": "Contract Start Date",
    "pdf": "March 10, 2025",
    "web": "10/03/2025",
    "match": false,
    "reason": "Missing value in Excel"
  }
]
