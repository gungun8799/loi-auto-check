You are given extracted data from up to three sources: PDF, Web, and Excel. These contain structured information from rent contracts.

Your task is to:
1. Extract the following fields from each source (if available):
- Unit number
- Type
- Customer
- Customer Address
- Customer Brand
- Building
- Area in square meter
- Contract Start Date
- Contract End Date
- Rent charge
- Service charge
- Other service charge (in the renting space)
- Other service charge (public space)
- Utilities charge (water)
- Utilities charge (Electricity)
- Utilities charge (cooking gas)
- Rent Insurance
- Service Insurance
- Land and building tax
- Name on Citizen ID card
- Address on Citizen ID card
- Citizen ID Number

2. Compare each field across the sources.
3. Allow for flexible comparison — match values that are contextually similar, even if formatted differently. Examples:
   - "March 10, 2025" vs "10/03/2025"
   - "$1,000.00" vs "1000"
   - "ซีพี" vs "CP"
   - With/without commas, units like "THB", or different date formats

4. If a value is missing in one or more sources, mark the match as **false**.

5. Return the result as a list of objects in this JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "field": "Customer",
    "pdf": "Wisarut Gunjarueg",
    "web": "Mr. Wisarut G.",
    "excel": "Wisarut Gunjarueg",
    "match": true,
    "reason": "All refer to the same person with different naming styles"
  },
  {
    "field": "Rent charge",
    "pdf": "$15,000.00",
    "web": "15000",
    "excel": "15,000.00 THB",
    "match": true,
    "reason": "Same value represented in different formats"
  },
  {
    "field": "Contract Start Date",
    "pdf": "March 10, 2025",
    "web": "10/03/2025",
    "excel": null,
    "match": false,
    "reason": "Missing value in Excel"
  }
]
