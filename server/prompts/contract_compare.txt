You are given extracted data from multiple sources such as PDF, Web, and Excel. Your task is to:

1. Identify all fields (e.g., Party Names, Total Amount, Start/End Dates).
2. Compare values across all sources for each field.
3. Check for semantic similarity â€” consider differences in formatting, synonyms, or partial matches. For example:
   - "Wisarut Gunjarueg" and "Mr. Wisarut G." should be considered a likely match.
   - "$1,000.00" and "1000" should match.
   - "March 10, 2025" and "10/03/2025" should match.
   - Buddhist year and international year
4. Return the result as a list of field comparisons with a "match" boolean and explanation.
5. If there null value, the match must be false

Use this JSON format in your response:

```json
[
  {
    "field": "Party Names",
    "pdf": "Wisarut Gunjarueg",
    "web": "Mr. Wisarut G.",
    "excel": "Wisarut Gunjarueg",
    "match": true,
    "reason": "All values refer to the same person with different formats"
  },
  {
    "field": "Total Amount",
    "pdf": "$1000",
    "web": "$1050",
    "excel": "$1000",
    "match": false,
    "reason": "Web source has a different amount"
  }
]
