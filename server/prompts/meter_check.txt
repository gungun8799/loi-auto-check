You are given the raw text of a “Meter” detail page (HTML/text below), which includes serial numbers and a “Status” column for each. Your job is to detect whether each of these meter types has at least one **Active** serial:

  • Electricity meter: any serial containing “EH”  
  • Water meter:       any serial containing “WH”  
  • Gas meter:         any serial containing “GH”  

Produce **exactly** a JSON array of objects, using this format:

[
  {
    "field": "Field name",
    "value": "yes" or "no",
    "valid": true or false,
    "reason": "Explanation or status"
  }
]

– The three fields must be exactly:
  “Electricity Meter Present”  
  “Water Meter Present”  
  “Gas Meter Present”  

For each field:
  • **value** = “yes” if you found at least one matching serial whose **Status** is “Active”; otherwise “no”.  
  • **valid** = true when value is “yes”, false when “no”.  
  • **reason** =  
      – If valid: “Found serial `<the-actual-serial>` with status Active”  
      – Else if you found one or more matching serials but none are Active:  
          “Found serial `<first-serial-found>` but status `<its-status>`”  
      – Else (no matching serials at all):  
          “No `<Electricity|Water|Gas>` serial found”  

Below is the raw page content. Do **not** output any explanatory text—only return the JSON array.
